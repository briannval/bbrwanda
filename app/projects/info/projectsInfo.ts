Our vision involves revitalizing the Covaga Innovation Centre by completing the construction of the two remaining buildings. One of these edifices will be designated as a weaving studio, providing an essential space for the weavers. Simultaneously, the second building is planned to serve as a kitchen where nutritionists can instruct participants on preparing nutritious quinoa-based meals. The adjacent courtyard will offer a welcoming environment for patrons to relish their meals, engage in social interactions, and potentially attend entertaining events.",

  about:
    "Quinoa is a highly nutritious, drought-resistant crop that has the potential to significantly improve nutrition diversity, food security and health in the region. This project aims to demonstrate the viability and benefits of quinoa cultivation, provide training and education to local farmers and community members, and promote quinoa as a key element in a diversified and resilient food system. By diversifying crops and improving nutrition, we aim to enhance the overall well-being of the community, reduce food insecurity, and increase the resilience of the local agricultural sector.",
  sustainability:
    "To ensure the sustainability of the project, we will work closely with the community and local partners, transferring knowledge and resources gradually. The establishment of a quinoa farmers&#39; association will play a key role in long-term sustainability, ensuring ongoing support and collaboration. The project will also encourage seed saving and exchange among local farmers, establishing a community cooperative for quinoa production, consumption, and marketing.",
  potential:
    "The Quinoa Demonstration Garden project in Gashora, Bugesera, Rwanda, has the potential to dramatically improve the lives of local residents by addressing malnutrition and poverty, food insecurity, and fostering lasting positive change. This project aligns with national and the global UN Sustainable Development Goals and will serve as a transformational model for other regions facing similar food and poverty challenges.",

  history:
    " Almost over two decades ago, Rwanda faced significant environmental challenges with the proliferation of the water hyacinth, an invasive weed originally from the Amazon River basin in South America. This aggressive plant choked lakes and rivers, blocking the sunlight from reaching the water, which disrupted the natural balance of aquatic ecosystems. Lakes were gradually disappearing as the water hyacinth continued to multiply and form dense mats on the water's surface. Seeking a sustainable solution to this environmental crisis, COVAGA members began clearing the water hyacinth from the lakes and then used the stems of the water hyacinth to create a range of products, including hats, fruit baskets, and wall decorations. What sets COVAGA’s work apart is their ability to transform an environmental problem into a sustainable solution by providing social and economic opportunities to the members through their weaving and selling of these innovative products to consumers.",
  construction:
    "Starting in 2009, BBR (Building Bridges with Rwanda) collaborated with various internal partners to facilitate the construction of the Covaga Innovation Centre. This purpose-built facility serves as a hub where COVAGA weavers not only carry out their craft but also market their products. Additionally, it provides a space for collaboration with other community members, fostering the exchange of ideas and skills. BBR's contribution to establishing this infrastructure significantly improved COVAGA's productivity and social well-being, particularly in terms of economic stability. The Covaga Innovation Centre has played a pivotal role in enhancing the cooperative's capacity to thrive and further contribute to the sustainable development of their community.",
  future:
    "BBR is presently embarking on a project aimed at revitalizing COVAGA by building more infrastructure, enhancing the Centre’s productivity, and strengthening economic stability for its members. This initiative serves as a ray of hope, transforming environmental challenges into a sustainable source of livelihood. It ensures a brighter future not only for the cooperative but also for the entire Gashora community. COVAGA aspires to be more than just a center of economic activity; it's destined to become a symbol of resilience, innovation, and empowerment. Through this collaboration, we aim to foster a thriving community while preserving age-old traditions and protecting the environment. Together, we are forging a path towards a sustainable and prosperous future for all involved.",

      "Provide Canadians with the first-hand experience of witnessing the success stories of sustainable development projects in Rwanda.",
      "Lead a Sustainable Development reflection tour to visit the four community projects in Rwanda and to stimulate Canadian and Rwandan partnerships and investments for these projects.",

    ],
  },
  overview:
    "The participants of the reflection tour will also visit a series of successful community organizations and their projects that are leaders in community development to gain awareness and knowledge of how Rwanda has become a global leader in sustainable development. The intention of this tour is to provide Canadians with opportunities to invest funding and resources in community projects developed in Rwanda and to create reciprocal trade partnerships between Canada and Rwanda.",
  goal: "The primary goal of the 2024 Sustainable Development Reflection Tour to Rwanda is to enlighten and educate Canadians on the Rwandan Development Model and how Rwanda is “the little country with big changes” as Rwanda has been recognized as an African and global leader in sustainable development, agriculture, technology and digital communications, gender equality and education. As a model for other nations, Rwanda has become a beacon of hope of how a country can lift itself up after the tragic 1994 genocide and pave a way forward by re-imagining a new, vibrant, inclusive and equitable Rwanda.",
  purpose:
    "Africa's image has been unfairly tarnished, often portrayed as a continent needing constant external assistance through a colonized lens. BBR is shedding light upon this image by initiating a campaign to showcase pan-African transformation with a focus on Rwanda to challenge this misconception. We intend to greatly shift this narrative by promoting excellent experiential learning through the reflection tour and how Canadians can take back lessons learned from African countries, such as Rwanda.",
  targetAudience:
    "Our project appeals to diverse audiences; it includes Africans in the diaspora, progressive organizations and institutions dedicated to social, environmental, and economic justice, and various individuals focusing on college/university students, researchers, and policymakers in the field of international development. Our audience will benefit from receiving evidence-based, engaging, and informative content that will assist and support them in better understanding the realities of sustainable development in Rwanda.",
  initiativeProject:
    "The reflection tour will take the participants through Rwanda's established successful development hotspots where they will have the opportunity to meet Rwandan change-makers who have significantly contributed to the nation's progress in a myriad of ways.
